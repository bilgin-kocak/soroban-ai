# Soroban Smart Contract Generator Chatbot

## Overview

The Soroban Smart Contract Generator Chatbot is an AI-powered tool designed to facilitate the creation of Soroban smart contracts directly from user text inputs. Leveraging a Large Language Model (LLM) and fine-tuning techniques, the chatbot interprets user requirements and generates structured Soroban smart contract code.

## Features

- Natural Language Understanding (NLU): Capable of understanding user intents and extracting key details for contract generation.

- Template-based Approach: Uses predefined templates to structure and generate Soroban smart contract code.

- Fine-tuning LLM: Fine-tuned LLM model to ensure accurate and contextually relevant contract generation.

- Validation and Error Handling: Implements validation checks to ensure generated contracts adhere to Soroban syntax and semantic rules.

- User Guidance: Provides clear prompts and guidance to users on input requirements and usage.

- Deployment Integration: Seamless integration with Soroban or other platforms for deploying generated smart contracts.

Example

```
User: Create a Soroban hello world smart contract.

Chatbot: Generating Soroban smart contract...
         Contract created successfully:

            #![no_std]
            use soroban_sdk::{contract, contractimpl, vec, Env, String, Vec};

            #[contract]
            pub struct HelloContract;

            #[contractimpl]
            impl HelloContract {
                pub fn hello(env: Env, to: String) -> Vec<String> {
                    vec![&env, String::from_str(&env, "Hello"), to]
                }
            }

            mod test;
```
