# SorobanGenie

## Overview

SorobanGenie is an AI-powered chatbot designed to simplify the creation of Soroban smart contracts on the Stellar blockchain. By converting user text inputs into functional smart contracts, SorobanGenie democratizes access to blockchain technology, making it accessible to developers, businesses, and individuals without extensive coding knowledge.

## Problem Solved

Creating smart contracts traditionally requires specialized programming skills and a deep understanding of blockchain technology. SorobanGenie addresses these challenges by providing a user-friendly interface where users can input their requirements in plain language. The AI chatbot then generates the corresponding Soroban smart contract, simplifying the process, reducing errors, and speeding up deployment.

## Benefits

- **For Developers**: Streamlines the contract creation process, allowing developers to focus on higher-level logic and application development.
- **For Businesses**: Enables quicker deployment of blockchain solutions, enhancing efficiency and reducing costs.
- **For Individuals**: Makes blockchain technology accessible to non-programmers, fostering broader adoption and innovation.

## How It Works

1. **User Interaction**: Users interact with SorobanGenie through a chat interface, providing details about the smart contract they need.
2. **Natural Language Processing**: The chatbot uses advanced NLP techniques to understand the user's requirements and convert them into structured data.
3. **Contract Generation**: Leveraging a fine-tuned Large Language Model (LLM), SorobanGenie generates the appropriate Soroban smart contract code.
4. **Validation**: The generated contract is validated for syntax and logical correctness to ensure it meets the specified requirements.
5. **Deployment**: Users can deploy the contract directly on the Stellar blockchain, benefiting from its fast, efficient, and secure network.

## Blockchain Integration

SorobanGenie utilizes the Stellar blockchain, known for its high-speed transactions, low fees, and energy efficiency. Soroban, Stellar's smart contract platform, provides the underlying infrastructure, allowing SorobanGenie to create robust and scalable smart contracts. By integrating with Stellar, SorobanGenie ensures that all transactions are secure, transparent, and immutable, leveraging blockchain's core strengths.

Example

```
User: Create a Soroban hello world smart contract.

Chatbot: Generating Soroban smart contract...
         Contract created successfully:

            #![no_std]
            use soroban_sdk::{contract, contractimpl, vec, Env, String, Vec};

            #[contract]
            pub struct HelloContract;

            #[contractimpl]
            impl HelloContract {
                pub fn hello(env: Env, to: String) -> Vec<String> {
                    vec![&env, String::from_str(&env, "Hello"), to]
                }
            }

            mod test;
```
